# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction  
This repository explores the concept of **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  
The goal is to understand how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and validated to ensure that software products meet business and user needs effectively.  
By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a structured overview of the process, activities, and tools used in requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?  
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do. It involves understanding the needs of stakeholders and transforming them into clear, actionable, and testable requirements.  

### Importance in SDLC:
- It defines **what the system should achieve** before development begins.  
- It ensures **alignment between stakeholders and developers**.  
- It reduces **project risks** by detecting misunderstandings early.  

Requirement Analysis sets the foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment, ensuring that the end product meets user expectations.
