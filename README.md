# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction  

This repository explores the concept of **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  
The goal is to understand how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and validated to ensure that software products meet business and user needs effectively.  
By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a structured overview of the process, activities, and tools used in requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?  

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do. It involves understanding the needs of stakeholders and transforming them into clear, actionable, and testable requirements.  

### Importance in SDLC:

- It defines **what the system should achieve** before development begins.  
- It ensures **alignment between stakeholders and developers**.  
- It reduces **project risks** by detecting misunderstandings early.  

Requirement Analysis sets the foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment, ensuring that the end product meets user expectations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

Requirement Analysis is vital in software development for several key reasons:

1. **Clarity and Understanding**  
   It provides a clear understanding of what the client wants, ensuring all stakeholders are on the same page before development begins.

2. **Risk Reduction**  
   By identifying potential issues and ambiguities early, teams can prevent costly rework later in the project.

3. **Efficient Resource Management**  
   Well-defined requirements help in accurate estimation of time, cost, and effort required to complete the project.
